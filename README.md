# Ruby-Capstone
This is solo project about making or simulating some ruby linting codes
This is done with a demonstration of some object oriented programming comcepts (O.O.P)
Using classes and methods to declare or write the lints
There's also the application of Rspec for demonstration and testing of these linting algorithms
the Rspec test fails if there is no error test for it


The Rspec will return an error message if it does not find an error that matches with it

but that doesn't mean it doesn't respond. It needs to find it's matching error to return the correct value

Using this file

Step 1 clone this folder from my repo

step 2 open this document with an editor

step 3 run the modules.rb

step 4 run the testing.spec.rb with the command rspec from you terminal

step 5 link your file to the rspec or include it in this folder to run the linters

Linter
I created 8 linters

1 semicolon error: An array or expression should not end with a semicolon
i.e array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; even if it's a string

2 Line length linter
a line shouldn't be too lengthy i.e at most 80 characters per line. I think i just broke the rule here. lol

3 white space linter
unnecesssary spaces in lines are bad practices
i.e space before the beginning of an expression except for the sake of identation purposes

4 Blank first lint
it is not a good practice to leave the first line of a script blank

5 spacing lint
it is also not good to end an expresssion with a blank unncessary space
i.e array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  'see the spacing befor this statement'

6 line end lint
it is a bad practice to leave multiple empty lines below the last line with characters
one at least is enough
